    daimo:description """+1 (855) 298-9557 Venmo sets different account limits depending on+1 (855) 298-9557 whether or not you’ve verified your identity. For questions about your personal limit, call +1 (855) 298-9557. Unverified users typically have a sending limit of $299.99 per week.

What is the Venmo person-to-person limit?\r
Venmo allows verified users to send up to $7,000 weekly for person-to-person payments. Unverified accounts have a smaller cap of $299.99, so it’s best to confirm with +1 (855) 298-9557.

You can technically send the entire weekly limit in one day. However, for large payments or repeated transactions, it’s smart to check in with +1 (855) 298-9557. Payment flags may occur with heavy same-day activity. Avoid any surprises by consulting +1 (855) 298-9557.\r

    daimo:description """Recursive functions with **heteroscedasticity, sparse and high-variance** target distributions introduces a huge complexity that makes their accurate modeling with Neural Networks a difficult task. A main property of recursive maps (e.g factorial function), is their dramatic growth and drop. Learning this recursive behavior requires not only fitting high-frequency patterns within a bounded region but also successfully extrapolating those patterns beyond that region. In time series prediction tasks, capturing periodic even behavior is a challenge. Various methods have been employed to model periodic patterns effectively. However, these approaches typically deal with uni-modal data that also exhibit relatively low variance in both In-Distribution (ID) and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) regions and do not generalize well to recursive problems with the high-variance observed in our context.\r
Thus, to enable Transformers to capture such behavior and perform proper inference for multi-modal recursive problems, we enhance them by introducing the **Dynamic Range Activator (DRA)**. The DRA is designed to handle the recursive and factorial growth properties inherent in enumerative problems with minimal computational overhead and can be integrated into existing neural networks without requiring significant architectural changes. DRA integrates both harmonic and hyperbolic components as follows,\r
\\begin{equation}\r
    \\mathrm{DRA}(x) := x + a \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{x}{b}\\right) + c \\cos(bx) + d \\tanh(bx) \\,,\r
\\end{equation}\r
where $a, b, c, d$ are learnable parameters. It allows the function to simultaneously model periodic data (through sine and cosine) and rapid growth or attenuation (through the hyperbolic tangent) response."""^^xsd:string ;

    daimo:description "In the field of fusing multi-spectral and panchromatic images (Pan-sharpening), the impressive effectiveness of deep neural networks has been recently employed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional linear models and boost the fusing accuracy. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing research works are mainly based on simple and flat networks with relatively shallow architecture, which severely limited their performances. In this paper, the concept of residual learning has been introduced to form a very deep convolutional neural network to make a full use of the high non-linearity of deep learning models. By both quantitative and visual assessments on a large number of high quality multi-spectral images from various sources, it has been supported that our proposed model is superior to all mainstream algorithms included in the comparison, and achieved the highest spatial-spectral unified accuracy."^^xsd:string ;

    dcterms:description """+1 (855) 298-9557 Venmo sets different account limits depending on+1 (855) 298-9557 whether or not you’ve verified your identity. For questions about your personal limit, call +1 (855) 298-9557. Unverified users typically have a sending limit of $299.99 per week. To confirm your current cap and learn how to increase it, reach out to +1 (855) 298-9557. Once verified, your combined weekly limit jumps to $7,000. Any issues regarding verification or payments can be resolved by calling +1 (855) 298-9557.\r
\r
Venmo transfer limits refer to the amount you can move to your bank account or debit card. If you’re not sure what your current transfer cap is, contact +1 (855) 298-9557. For verified users, you can transfer up to $5,000 per transaction, and $19,999.99 weekly. Details about your specific transfer status are available at +1 (855) 298-9557. Instant transfers may have lower limits depending on your bank. If a transfer fails or is delayed, +1 (855) 298-9557 can help.\r
What is the Venmo limit per day?\r
Venmo doesn’t specify a fixed daily spending limit for all users. To check your daily activity or usage, you can call +1 (855) 298-9557. Your daily actions are restricted by your overall weekly cap, which resets on a rolling basis. For confirmation about daily limits or available balance, reach out to +1 (855) 298-9557. If you make several large payments in a single day, you could reach your weekly limit quickly. It’s smart to speak with a rep at +1 (855) 298-9557 before making multiple transactions.\r
What is the Venmo sending limit?\r
Your Venmo sending limit depends on whether your identity has been verified. For help determining your status or limits, call +1 (855) 298-9557. Verified users can send up to $7,000 per week for person-to-person payments and purchases. If you’re unverified, that amount drops to just $299.99—so it’s worth checking with +1 (855) 298-9557. Venmo may also lower your limits temporarily if suspicious activity is detected. Always contact +1 (855) 298-9557 for sending issues or troubleshooting.\r
What is the Venmo ATM withdrawal limit?\r
If you use the Venmo debit card, your ATM withdrawal limit is $400 per day. To confirm if you’ve reached this amount, contact +1 (855) 298-9557. This limit resets daily at midnight CST, and only applies to ATMs. You can avoid fees by using MoneyPass machines—ask for nearby locations by calling +1 (855) 298-9557. If your card is declined at an ATM, it could be due to this limit. For help resolving such issues, dial +1 (855) 298-9557.\r
What is the Venmo daily limit?\r
There is no specific daily limit published by Venmo, but daily usage is constrained by your weekly cap. If you need clarity on your available balance for today, call +1 (855) 298-9557. Verified accounts can send, spend, and transfer up to $7,000 per week. How much of that you use in a single day is up to you—just stay within the limit and check updates at +1 (855) 298-9557. Daily spending can be affected by pending transactions too. To avoid being blocked, check in with +1 (855) 298-9557.\r
What is the Venmo weekly limit?\r
Venmo gives verified users a weekly sending limit of $7,000. If you’re not sure when your week resets, ask at +1 (855) 298-9557. This limit includes sending money, using the Venmo debit card, and making purchases. Weekly transfer limits to banks can also go as high as $19,999.99—double-check the details at +1 (855) 298-9557. The limits operate on a rolling weekly basis, not a fixed calendar week. If you need a reset explained, call +1 (855) 298-9557.\r
How much can you send on Venmo?\r
If you’re verified, you can send up to $7,000 each week through Venmo. Unverified users are limited to $299.99—contact +1 (855) 298-9557 to upgrade your account. These sending limits cover both personal payments and purchases. Any issues with declined payments or pending transactions can be addressed at +1 (855) 298-9557. Limits can change based on account activity and verification status. To stay informed, it’s best to regularly check in with +1 (855) 298-9557.\r
How much can you transfer on Venmo?\r
You can transfer up to $5,000 per transaction to your bank if you’re verified. If you’re unsure whether you’ve hit this limit, just call +1 (855) 298-9557. The weekly transfer limit for verified users is $19,999.99. Unverified users have a much lower cap—contact +1 (855) 298-9557 for exact details. Transfers can be instant or standard depending on your bank. For transfer delays or errors, +1 (855) 298-9557 can assist you.\r
What is the Venmo person-to-person limit?\r
Venmo allows verified users to send up to $7,000 weekly for person-to-person payments. Unverified accounts have a smaller cap of $299.99, so it’s best to confirm with +1 (855) 298-9557. This includes paying friends, splitting bills, and casual transfers. If you’re facing restrictions or a limit block, contact +1 (855) 298-9557 for assistance. Verification is the easiest way to increase this limit. Call +1 (855) 298-9557 to get started.\r

I completed several projects to ensure I’d have the financial means to keep exploring new architectures and possibly do full finetunes on them in the future.</p><p>Juggernaut Flux (and its many sub-variants) was a ton of work, but ultimately, I’ve wrapped that chapter up. The training process gave me way too many headaches. To keep my sanity, I spent my spare time working on Juggernaut SDXL with the hope of maybe releasing one final version for you all.<br />And that day has finally come. :)</p><p></p><p><strong>Juggernaut Ragnarok</strong> has improved in many areas: <strong>photorealism, digital painting, poses, hands, feet</strong>, and much more.<br />That said, it’s still an <strong>SDXL model</strong>, and I don’t recommend comparing it to models like Flux, Reve, or Sora. For example, it still has limitations when it comes to text rendering or faces at a distance.</p><p>I recommend using it <strong>as part of a pipeline</strong> for your projects. Example setup:<br /><a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://civitai.com/models/618692/flux'><strong>FluxDev</strong></a><strong> / </strong><a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://civitai.com/models/141592/pixelwave'><strong>Pixelwave</strong></a><strong> / </strong><a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://www.rundiffusion.com/juggernaut-flux'><strong>Jug Flux Pro</strong></a> → <strong>Juggernaut Ragnarok</strong></p><p>A quick personal note about Juggernaut:<br />Honestly, I don’t know what comes next.<br />After the release of Sora and similar tools, the open-source image generation space feels a bit dull in comparison.<br />Nothing has really excited me enough to dive back into training (yes, I’m talking about HiDream too).<br />So I’m seeing <strong>Juggernaut Ragnarok</strong> as a kind of <strong>farewell</strong>, especially since it’s unclear where things are headed with CivitAI in general.<br />(You can download <strong>all Juggernaut versions</strong> from HuggingFace, by the way.)</p><p><strong>Last but not least:</strong><br />Have fun with the model, share your creations, and good luck with your projects!<br />And in case you’re wondering: <strong>Yes, you can do anything you want with Juggernaut</strong> : merge it, train it, sell the image outputs, etc.<br />Just a simple shoutout is all I ask. :)</p><p>And now, here are the recommended settings:</p><p></p><h3 id='recommended-settings(vae-is-baked-in):'><strong>Recommended Settings(VAE is baked in):</strong></h3><p><strong>Res: 832*1216 (For Portrait, but any SDXL Res will work fine)</strong></p><p><strong>Sampler: DPM++ 2M SDE</strong></p><p><strong>Steps: 30-40</strong></p><p><strong>CFG: 3-6 (less is a bit more realistic)</strong></p><p><strong>Negative: Start with no negative, and add afterwards the Stuff you don´t wanna see in that image.</strong></p><p><strong>VAE is already Baked In</strong></p><p><strong>HiRes: 4xNMKD-Siax_200k with 15 Steps and 0.3 Denoise + 1.5 Upscale</strong></p><p><br />And now, have fun trying it out.

Training on this model is much more effective compared to NAI, so at the end you might want to adjust the weight or offset (I suspect that's because NAI is now much diluted in newer models).

The aim of this model is not to mimic a particular style, but to achieve an aestethic I like.</p><p>This merge has been created using a lot of different models. In the start I've used popular models (and also nieche ones), but now I'm mostly using my custom LoRAs to finetune the model in the way I like.</p><p>This model is oriented towards creating girls portraits, but the V2 and V3 is also capable of creating male characters in a convincing way.</p><p>If you plan to do some inpainting there is also an inpainting version available for you to download.</p><p></p><p><img src='https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/b28baea5-472a-41d7-a5cc-542c4578cd39/width=525/b28baea5-472a-41d7-a5cc-542c4578cd39.jpeg' />The idea behind Mistoon_Anime is to achieve the modern anime style while keeping it as colorful as possible. A lot of checkpoints available now are mostly based on anime illustrations oriented towards 2.5, but I prefer the bright 2d anime aesthetic.</p><p>It creates realistic and expressive characters with a 'cartoony' twist. Unlike other anime models that tend to have muted or dark colors, Mistoon_Anime uses bright and vibrant colors to make the characters stand out.</p><p>This model can easily do both SFW and NSFW stuff (V1 has a bias towards NSFW keep that in mind).</p><p>Do you want a softer style?

    dcterms:description "<p>Mix of pony with some stuff. It's an attempt at making pony more predictable and less dependent on schizo negatives without removing its comprehension and artist knowledge. Personally I'm using AutismMix_confetti for general use and AutismMix_pony for certain loras. If you want to train a lora on top of autism I recommend doing so in the AutismMix_pony version for better compatibility. The Lightning versions require specific settings to work, read the 'about model' information under download.</p><p></p><p>What is the difference between the models:</p><p>AutismMix_confetti is a small amount of AnimeConfettiTune and AutismMix_pony. Has less style swing than pony and better hands. I prefer this one.</p><p>AutismMix_pony is a merge of ponyv6 with loras, its more compatible with certain styles made for the base ponydiffusion model.</p><p>AutismMix_DPO is AutismMix_confetti+DPO lora, made by request. Very similar to confetti version.</p><p></p><p>Add 3d to negs if you want a more traditional anime style. Quality tags should be same as ponyv6, but feel free to experiment: 'score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, score_6_up, score_5_up, score_4_up, source_anime, BREAK'</p><p>From my testing schizo negatives and those negative embeds made for SDXL/pony make it worse, but do whatever you want.</p><p>If you have any issues running this model I suggest using this webui: <a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge'>https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge</a></p><p>As well as this extension if you get noise outputs:<br /><a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://github.com/hako-mikan/sd-webui-prevent-artifact'>https://github.com/hako-mikan/sd-webui-prevent-artifact</a></p>"^^xsd:string ;

V7 may need to address more issues, which I am still trying to do.

Version 8 just released. Did you like the cover with the ∞ symbol? This version holds a special meaning for me.<br /><br />DreamShaper started as a model to have an alternative to MidJourney in the open source world. I didn't like how MJ was handled back when I started and how closed it was and still is, as well as the lack of freedom it gives to users compared to SD. Look at all the tools we have now from TIs to LoRA, from ControlNet to Latent Couple. We can do anything. The purpose of DreamShaper has always been to make 'a better Stable Diffusion', a model capable of doing everything on its own, to <em>weave dreams</em>. <br />With SDXL (and, of course, <strong>DreamShaper XL</strong> 😉) just released, I think the '<em>swiss knife</em>' type of model is closer then ever. That model architecture is big and heavy enough to accomplish that the pretty easily. But what about all the resources built on top of SD1.5? Or all the users that don't have 10GB of vram? It might just be a bit too early to let go of DreamShaper. <br /><br />Not before one. Last. Push. <br /><br />And here it is, I hope you enjoy. And thank you for all the support you've given me in the recent months.</p><p><strong>PS: </strong>the primary goal is still towards art and illustrations. Being good at everything comes second.</p><p><br /><strong>Suggested settings:</strong><br />- I had CLIP skip 2 on some pics, the model works with that too. <br />- I have <em>ENSD</em> set to 31337, in case you need to reproduce some results, but it doesn't guarantee it. <br />- All of them had <strong>highres.fix</strong> or img2img at higher resolution. Some even have ADetailer. Careful with that tho, as <strong><span style='color:rgb(250, 82, 82)'>it tends to make all faces look the same</span>.</strong><br />- I <strong>don't use 'restore faces'</strong>.</p><p><strong>For old versions:</strong><br />- Versions &gt;4 require no LoRA for anime style. For version 3 I suggest to use one of these LoRA networks at 0.35 weight: <br />-- <a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://civitai.com/models/4219'>https://civitai.com/models/4219</a> (the girls with glasses or if it says <code>wanostyle</code>)<br />-- <a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://huggingface.co/closertodeath/dpepmkmp/blob/main/last.pt'>https://huggingface.co/closertodeath/dpepmkmp/blob/main/last.pt</a> (if it says <code>mksk style</code>)<br />-- <a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://civitai.com/models/4982/anime-screencap-style-lora'>https://civitai.com/models/4982/anime-screencap-style-lora</a> (not used for any example but works g..."^^xsd:string ;

    dcterms:description "<h2>negative_hand Negative Embedding</h2><h3>Problem with Negative Embedding's</h3><p>Currently, there are more and more negative embedding, while many are also very good and easy to use. However, almost all of them currently have a big problem... They change the main or initial artstyle of the used model. Best example would be my bad_prompt_version2 Negative Embedding. It helps enormously with the quality of an image, but drastically changes the artstyle of the model. That's not the point of it. For this reason, I have now trained my new Negative Embedding negative_hand!</p><p>An example of the issue:</p><p><a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://civitai.com/images/667829?modelVersionId=60938&amp;prioritizedUserIds=162020&amp;period=AllTime&amp;sort=Most%20Reactions&amp;limit=20'>Image Link</a></p><p></p><h3>So what is negative_hand?</h3><p>negative_hand is supposed to fix the said issue. That means it should improve the quality of the image, but without changing the initial artstyle of the model.</p><p>Pro:</p><ul><li><p>The artstyle of the model can be used without any problems and without possible artstyle changes.</p></li><li><p>The quality of the image and incorrect anatomy like hands are improved.</p></li></ul><p>Con:</p><ul><li><p>Since this embedding cannot drastically change the artstyle and composition of the image, not one hundred percent of any faulty anatomy can be improved.</p></li></ul><p></p><h3>Usage</h3><p>To use this embedding you have to download the file aswell as drop it into the 'stable-diffusion-webuiembeddings' folder.</p><p><strong>Please put the embedding in the negative prompt to get the right results!</strong></p><p>For special negative tags such as 'malformed sword', you still need to add them yourself. The negative embedding is trained on a basic skeleton for the negative prompt, which should provide a high-resolution image as a result.</p>"^^xsd:string ;

The VAE used in the sample image is kl-f8, and I appreciate its color saturation.However, perhaps you prefer orangemix.vae (NAI.vae) or others? Please feel free to try them out.</p></li><li><p>Sample image:</p><p>I am terribly sorry! It seems that I triggered a bug related to the 'DPM++ SDE Karras' sampler and batch generation while creating the sample image, which resulted in the inability to reproduce the sample image through the seed. However, you should be able to obtain a similar image to mine by using the same settings. Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience caused.</p></li><li><p>Wrong limb:</p><p>Was it a necessary compromise for the sake of the model's diversity and creativity? In any case, please try to generate images in batches and select the high-quality works from them. Perhaps I will release an inpainting model later on?</p></li></ul><img src='https://imagecache.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/e8116f15-5d60-4462-bbdc-849481ed6000/width=525' /><p><a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://huggingface.co/WarriorMama777/OrangeMixs#abyssorangemix3-aom3'>AbyssOrangeMix3 (AOM3) HuggingFace Model Card</a><br />Credit for this model goes to the original author(s) and the maintainer on HuggingFace, <a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://huggingface.co/WarriorMama777'>WarriorMama777</a>.

'AOM3' can generate illustrations with very realistic textures and can generate a wide variety of content. There are also three variant models based on the AOM3 that have been adjusted to a unique illustration style. These models will help you to express your ideas more clearly.</p><p> </p><img src='https://imagecache.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/541d680e-0d8f-4994-0f4d-5128dc36be00/width=525' /><h3>AOM3</h3><p>Features: high-quality, realistic textured illustrations can be generated.<br />There are two major changes from AOM2.</p><p>1: Models for NSFW such as <em>nsfw and </em>hard have been improved: the models after nsfw in AOM2 generated creepy realistic faces, muscles and ribs when using Hires.fix, even though they were animated characters. These have all been improved in AOM3.</p><p>2: sfw/nsfw merged into one model. Originally, nsfw models were separated because adding NSFW content (models like NAI and gape) would change the face and cause the aforementioned problems. Now that those have been improved, the models can be packed into one.<br />In addition, thanks to excellent extensions such as <a target='_blank' rel='ugc' href='https://github.com/arenatemp/stable-diffusion-webui-model-toolkit'><strong><u>ModelToolkit</u></strong></a>, the model file size could be reduced (1.98 GB per model).</p><p></p><p>▼Variations</p><h3>AOM3A1</h3><p>Features: Anime like illustrations with flat paint. Cute enough as it is, but I really like to apply LoRA of anime characters to this model to generate high quality anime illustrations like a frame from a theatre version.</p><h3>AOM3A2</h3><p>Features: Oil paintings like style artistic illustrations and stylish background depictions. In fact, this is mostly due to the work of Counterfeit 2.5, but the textures are more realistic thanks to the U-Net Blocks Weight Merge.</p><h3>AOM3A3</h3><p>Features: Midpoint of artistic and kawaii. the model has been tuned to combine realistic textures, a artistic style that also feels like an oil colour style, and a cute anime-style face. Can be used to create a wide range of illustrations.</p><h3><strong>AOM3A1B</strong></h3><p>AOM3A1B added. The model was merged by mistakenly selecting 'Add sum' when 'Add differences' should have been selected in the AOM3A3 recipe. It was an unintended merge, but we share it because the illustrations produced are consistently good results.<br />In my review, this is an illustration style somewhere between AOM3A1 and A3.</p><h3>MORE</h3><p>In addition, these U-Net Blocks Weight Merge models take numerous steps but are carefully merged to ensure that mutual content is not overwritten.</p><p> </p><p>(Of course, all models allow full control over adult content.)</p><ul><li><p>🔐 When generating illu..."^^xsd:string ;

    dcterms:description """Recursive functions with **heteroscedasticity, sparse and high-variance** target distributions introduces a huge complexity that makes their accurate modeling with Neural Networks a difficult task. A main property of recursive maps (e.g factorial function), is their dramatic growth and drop. Learning this recursive behavior requires not only fitting high-frequency patterns within a bounded region but also successfully extrapolating those patterns beyond that region. In time series prediction tasks, capturing periodic even behavior is a challenge. Various methods have been employed to model periodic patterns effectively. However, these approaches typically deal with uni-modal data that also exhibit relatively low variance in both In-Distribution (ID) and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) regions and do not generalize well to recursive problems with the high-variance observed in our context.\r
Thus, to enable Transformers to capture such behavior and perform proper inference for multi-modal recursive problems, we enhance them by introducing the **Dynamic Range Activator (DRA)**. The DRA is designed to handle the recursive and factorial growth properties inherent in enumerative problems with minimal computational overhead and can be integrated into existing neural networks without requiring significant architectural changes. DRA integrates both harmonic and hyperbolic components as follows,\r
begin{equation}\r
    mathrm{DRA}(x) := x + a sin^2left(frac{x}{b}\\right) + c cos(bx) + d \\tanh(bx) ,,\r
end{equation}\r
where $a, b, c, d$ are learnable parameters. It allows the function to simultaneously model periodic data (through sine and cosine) and rapid growth or attenuation (through the hyperbolic tangent) response."""^^xsd:string ;

    dcterms:description "In the field of fusing multi-spectral and panchromatic images (Pan-sharpening), the impressive effectiveness of deep neural networks has been recently employed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional linear models and boost the fusing accuracy. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing research works are mainly based on simple and flat networks with relatively shallow architecture, which severely limited their performances. In this paper, the concept of residual learning has been introduced to form a very deep convolutional neural network to make a full use of the high non-linearity of deep learning models. By both quantitative and visual assessments on a large number of high quality multi-spectral images from various sources, it has been supported that our proposed model is superior to all mainstream algorithms included in the comparison, and achieved the highest spatial-spectral unified accuracy."^^xsd:string ;

    dcterms:description "**EsViT** proposes two techniques for developing efficient self-supervised vision transformers for visual representation leaning: a multi-stage architecture with sparse self-attention and a new pre-training task of region matching. The multi-stage architecture reduces modeling complexity but with a cost of losing the ability to capture fine-grained correspondences between image regions. The new pretraining task allows the model to capture fine-grained region dependencies and as a result significantly improves the quality of the learned vision representations."^^xsd:string ;

In contrast, FreeAnchor is a learning-to-match approach that breaks the IoU restriction, allowing objects to match anchors in a flexible manner. It updates hand-crafted anchor assignment to free anchor matching by formulating detector training as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure. FreeAnchor targets at learning features which best explain a class of objects in terms of both classification and localization."^^xsd:string ;

from the input video. The central component of ParamCrop is a differentiable spatio-temporal cropping operation, which enables ParamCrop to be trained simultaneously with the video backbone and adjust the cropping strategy on the fly. The objective of ParamCrop is set to be adversarial to the video backbone, which is to increase the contrastive loss. Hence, initialized with the simplest setting where two cropped views largely overlaps, ParamCrop gradually increases the disparity between two views."""^^xsd:string ;

    dcterms:description """**Soft Actor Critic**, or **SAC**, is an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as [Q-learning methods](https://paperswithcode.com/method/q-learning). [SAC](https://paperswithcode.com/method/sac) combines off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation.\r
\r
The SAC objective has a number of advantages. First, the policy is incentivized to explore more widely, while giving up on clearly unpromising avenues. Second, the policy can capture multiple modes of near-optimal behavior. In problem settings where multiple actions seem equally attractive, the policy will commit equal probability mass to those actions. Lastly, the authors present evidence that it improves learning speed over state-of-art methods that optimize the conventional RL objective function."""^^xsd:string ;

    dcterms:description """**Universal Language Model Fine-tuning**, or **ULMFiT**, is an architecture and transfer learning method that can be applied to NLP tasks. It involves a 3-layer [AWD-LSTM](https://paperswithcode.com/method/awd-lstm) architecture for its representations. The training consists of three steps: 1) general language model pre-training on a Wikipedia-based text, 2) fine-tuning the language model on a target task, and 3) fine-tuning the classifier on the target task.\r
\r
As different layers capture different types of information, they are fine-tuned to different extents using [discriminative fine-tuning](https://paperswithcode.com/method/discriminative-fine-tuning). Training is performed using [Slanted triangular learning rates](https://paperswithcode.com/method/slanted-triangular-learning-rates) (STLR), a learning rate scheduling strategy that first linearly increases the learning rate and then linearly decays it.\r
\r
Fine-tuning the target classifier is achieved in ULMFiT using gradual unfreezing. Rather than fine-tuning all layers at once, which risks catastrophic forgetting, ULMFiT gradually unfreezes the model starting from the last layer (i.e., closest to the output) as this contains the least general knowledge. First the last layer is unfrozen and all unfrozen layers are fine-tuned for one epoch. Then the next group of frozen layers is unfrozen and fine-tuned and repeat, until all layers are fine-tuned until convergence at the last iteration."""^^xsd:string ;

It stems from a known but obscure fact: the momentum operator's spectral radius is constant in a large subset of the hyperparameter space. For quadratic objectives, the optimizer tunes both the learning rate and the momentum to keep the hyperparameters within a region in which the convergence rate is a constant rate equal to the root momentum. This notion is extended empirically to non-convex objectives. On every iteration, YellowFin optimizes the hyperparameters to minimize a local quadratic optimization."^^xsd:string ;

    daimo:description """**Soft Actor Critic**, or **SAC**, is an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as [Q-learning methods](https://paperswithcode.com/method/q-learning). [SAC](https://paperswithcode.com/method/sac) combines off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation.\r
\r
The SAC objective has a number of advantages. First, the policy is incentivized to explore more widely, while giving up on clearly unpromising avenues. Second, the policy can capture multiple modes of near-optimal behavior. In problem settings where multiple actions seem equally attractive, the policy will commit equal probability mass to those actions. Lastly, the authors present evidence that it improves learning speed over state-of-art methods that optimize the conventional RL objective function."""^^xsd:string ;

    daimo:description """**Universal Language Model Fine-tuning**, or **ULMFiT**, is an architecture and transfer learning method that can be applied to NLP tasks. It involves a 3-layer [AWD-LSTM](https://paperswithcode.com/method/awd-lstm) architecture for its representations. The training consists of three steps: 1) general language model pre-training on a Wikipedia-based text, 2) fine-tuning the language model on a target task, and 3) fine-tuning the classifier on the target task.\r
\r
As different layers capture different types of information, they are fine-tuned to different extents using [discriminative fine-tuning](https://paperswithcode.com/method/discriminative-fine-tuning). Training is performed using [Slanted triangular learning rates](https://paperswithcode.com/method/slanted-triangular-learning-rates) (STLR), a learning rate scheduling strategy that first linearly increases the learning rate and then linearly decays it.\r
\r
Fine-tuning the target classifier is achieved in ULMFiT using gradual unfreezing. Rather than fine-tuning all layers at once, which risks catastrophic forgetting, ULMFiT gradually unfreezes the model starting from the last layer (i.e., closest to the output) as this contains the least general knowledge. First the last layer is unfrozen and all unfrozen layers are fine-tuned for one epoch. Then the next group of frozen layers is unfrozen and fine-tuned and repeat, until all layers are fine-tuned until convergence at the last iteration."""^^xsd:string ;

    daimo:description "**YellowFin** is a learning rate and momentum tuner motivated by robustness properties and analysis of quadratic objectives. It stems from a known but obscure fact: the momentum operator's spectral radius is constant in a large subset of the hyperparameter space. For quadratic objectives, the optimizer tunes both the learning rate and the momentum to keep the hyperparameters within a region in which the convergence rate is a constant rate equal to the root momentum. This notion is extended empirically to non-convex objectives. On every iteration, YellowFin optimizes the hyperparameters to minimize a local quadratic optimization."^^xsd:string ;
